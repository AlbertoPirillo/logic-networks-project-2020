# Prova Finale - Reti Logiche 
 
### Engineering of Computing Systems @ Politecnico di Milano, AA. 2020-2021

The goal of the project is to use VHDL language to implement and synthesize an HW component capable of interacting with a memory to read an image, process that image using a histogram equalization algorithm and eventually write in memory the equalized image
